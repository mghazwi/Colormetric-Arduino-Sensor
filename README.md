# Colormetric Arduino Sensor
Arduino code for a project I did for the Hanze Healthy Aging Department, Groningen, Netherlands.
The sensor measures the color intensity of given sample which is placed in the sensor.
The sensor was used to measure the concentration of Creatinine in Urine sample based on the color intensity of the soltion. The solution contained mix of picric acid, NaOH, and Urine. 
The sensor has a Nextion touch screen attached to it to interact with the user. 
More details to come...
